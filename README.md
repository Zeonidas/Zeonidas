### Zeonidas

At the moment I'm a Security Systems Administrator moving into the development career field. I've been home developing for over 7 years. I am training to be a full stack developer and self-taught UI/UX designer. I enjoy making high quality websites and applications. I'm currently enrolled in a Software Engineering bootcamp to learn several languages. I think that you can never learn enough, so I'm always trying to learn new things.

### Current Projects
 - Currently working on my Capstone project using Python, Javascript, Flask, SQLAlchemy, Postgres, and HTML/CSS. Capstone is focused on mental health.
 - The non-alcholoic, which is a recipe book for individuals who would like to drink mocktails.
 - End user security tool, a tool that uses the VirusTotal API for users to check suspicious URL's or emails.
 
 ### Work Experience
 - Conduct QA review of code
 - Digital Forensics
 - Identify and mitigate malicious code
 - Splunk Programming Language (SPL)
 - Front-end development

My portfolio will go into more detail once deployed, but I think this is a good synopsis.
