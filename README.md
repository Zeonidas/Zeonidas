# I'm Zach

## About Me
I have over 15 years of experience in various fields of Information Technology, starting from the Help Desk, to digital records management, Jr and Sr System Administration for Windows and Linux environment, and Software Engineering. 

Recently, I decided to chase down my passion in Software Engineering and enrolled into Springboard to learn the ways of the industry and best practices. At the beginning of the course, I doubted my motives and was not sure I could complete the task that I put before myself. However, once I started, I knew this was me and what I needed to do. I was passionate about my work and the projects I presented.
