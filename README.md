- 👋 Hi, I’m @zeonitus
- 👀 I'm interested in full stack development.  I have experience with front-end development but not that much exposure to back-end development. I'm currently enrolled in a bootcamp to expan this knowledge.
- 🌱 I'm refreshing on front-end development at the moment.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on code that supports and brings recognition to mental health.  I will never turn down an opportunity though to learn more and network.
- 📫 Just send me an email.
